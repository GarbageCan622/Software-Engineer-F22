sandra's to do list (code):

already do:
necessary code is implemented, spaghettily
- i put it all onto one code file (scripts) FOR NOW (im fucking tired)
- this code is not my best code (not even fucking close), theres a lot of redundant things in here
- has not been tested to see if it works (it should work?)


will do:
- refactoring
- student class as a module or whatever
- html for adjust_self_scaling
- viewGrades() implementation 
- make toy instantiations of classes to test funtionality
